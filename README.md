# Sale Price of House Case Study

## Case study assignment by IIIT Bangalore and Upgrad

**Goal:**
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.


Utilizing advanced regression methods like Ridge and Lasso, the aim is to predict house prices for Surprise Housing, a US-based company venturing into the Australian real estate market. With a strategy centered on purchasing properties below market value and selling them for profit, the company seeks to leverage data analytics for informed decision-making.

For this purpose, Surprise Housing has amassed a dataset from Australian house sales, contained within the 'test.csv' file in the repository. This dataset serves as the foundation for building a regression model integrated with regularization techniques. The model's primary goal is to accurately predict the actual values of potential properties, aiding the company in determining the viability of investment opportunities.

Key inquiries driving this analysis include:
- Identification of pivotal variables influencing house prices.
- Assessment of how effectively these variables contribute to defining a house's price.

Leveraging GridSearchCV, the model undergoes an optimization process to pinpoint the optimal lambda, crucial for house price prediction via Ridge and Lasso regression techniques. This pursuit aims to provide Surprise Housing with a refined understanding of the variables influencing property prices, enabling informed decisions regarding potential investments in the Australian housing market.
